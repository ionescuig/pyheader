# pyheader
Creates a header for python scripts

pyheader.py needs to be copied to your current working directory.

This script is build for windows and linux.
For windows there are 3 editors avaible: IDLE, PyCharm (not working yet), Atom.
For linux there are 3 editors avaible: vim, gedit, nano.
Path for windows editors needs to be changed (current path is working on my computer).
If you don't have an editor and you will select it, the file will be created, but no editor will start.
